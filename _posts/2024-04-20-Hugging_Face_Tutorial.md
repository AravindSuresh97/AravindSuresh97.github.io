# Creating an Application on Hugging Face: A Step-by-Step Tutorial 

1. Introduction to Hugging Face:
- Hugging Face provides a free platform for hosting and sharing machine learning models.
- In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create an application using Hugging Face.
  
2. Setting Up Your Space:
- Start by logging into your Hugging Face account and navigating to the dashboard.
- Click on "New" and select "Space".

- Give your space a name and choose the ```apache2.0``` license - This allows other peoples to use your work easily, but you don‚Äôt have to worry too much about patents.

- Select the desired SDK. I have chosen Gradio here.

- Decide whether to make your space public or private for sharing.

I will look into why this is happening, and let me know if you are also facing the same issue. <br>
Okay, let‚Äôs get back into it.

3. Cloning the Repository:
- After creating your space, clone the repository associated with it.
- Copy the provided git clone command and paste it into your terminal.

- After running the git command, we will get a new directory which has the name of our space:<br>

4. Creating the Application:
- Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the newly created directory.
- Create a new file within this directory, named ```app.py```.
- Copy the code provided by Hugging Face for the application and paste it into ```app.py```.

- Open Visual Studio Code for the directory.
- Paste the copied code into the app.py file and save it.

- Commit the changes to the Hugging Face repository.

5. Understanding the Code:
```python
import gradio as gr
def greet(name): return f‚ÄùHello {name}!‚Äù
gr.Interface(fn=greet,inputs=‚Äùtext‚Äù,outputs=‚Äùtext‚Äù).launch()
```
It will have a gradio interface ‚Äì ```gr.interface```<br>
With a text input  - ```inputs=‚Äùtext‚Äù```<br>
And a text output ‚Äì ```outputs="text"```<br>
And this is going to run a  function called ‚Äògreet‚Äô on the inputs ‚Äì ```fn=greet```<br>
And the function greet will return Hello name: ```def greet(name): return f‚ÄùHello {name}!‚Äù```<br>

6. Testing the Application:
- Return to the Hugging Face website and navigate to your created space.
- Your application should now be available and running within the space.

- Test the application by providing input and observing the output.
